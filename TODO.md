- ChartJS++ wrapper (new project)
    - test compute + GUI (web page)
    -> cstr give canvas.

-> use signal with force update for now.
-> make ChartsHTML a sync wrapper for ChartJS++
    (how ?)
    - HTML -> JS trivial
    - JS   -> HTML => need listener + check to add HTML
        -> or ignore ???
        ~> only what HTML expose (?) - seems a good idea...
